- Algorithm: It is a finite set of instructions for solving problem.

- Programming: It is a set of instructions for a computer to follow to perform a task.

- Time complexity: The amount of time taken by an algorithm/code to run the given input.
  - time complexity for this code will be nothing but the number of steps.  
  - Big O notation: O(), O(no. of steps)

 - Three rules time complexity:
   - We will always calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario.
   - We will avoid including the constant terms.
   - We will also avoid the lower values.

  - Best Case: This term refers to the case where the code takes the least amount of time to get executed. 
  - Worst Case: This term refers to the case where the code takes the maximum amount of time to get executed. 


- Space complexity: The memory space that a code uses while being executed for given input.
