orchestration : clustering of any no. of containers running on different network.

- Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes 
  involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
- Kubernetes is also known as "k8s", with the 8 standing for the number of letters between the “K” and the “s”.
- It is a platform for managing containers, which bundle the code, configuration, and dependencies of an application, 
  allowing it to run as an isolated process. 
- Each application gets its own containers, which are grouped into Kubernetes pods.
- Kubernetes can run on bare metal servers, virtual machines, public cloud providers, private clouds, and hybrid cloud environments.

- Google developed the k8 and later they made it open source. Now Kubernetes is a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
- All the cloud provider supports k8.

- problems before k8 for managing container:
  - Containers can't communicate with each other.
  - Auto scalling and load balancing was not possible.

- features of k8:

1) Auto-scaling. Automatically scale containerized applications and their resources verically or horizontally based on usage.
   - vertical: Assigns more resources, like CPU or memory, to the pods that are already running.   
   - Horizontal: Adds or removes pods to scale capacity.

2) Load balancing: the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers or pods to ensure workload.
3) Platform Independent
4) Fault Tolerance: the ability of a cluster to continue operating when some of its components fails, ex. pod
5) Rollback: the concept of maintaining multiple versions of your application. 
6) Health monitoring of containers
7) Batch execution: the process of running tasks without user intervention.
