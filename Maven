Maven is a popular open-source powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model).
It is used for project build, dependency, and documentation of Java-based project.

- POM Files: Project Object Model 
  - It is a XML file that contains information related to the project and configuration information such as dependencies, source directory, plugin, etc.
  - Maven reads pom.xml file to accomplish its configuration and operations.
  - Every project have different pom file.

- Components of a POM File:

  - Project Coordinates:
    <groupId>: Defines the group or organization to which the project belongs.
    <artifactId>: The unique name of the project.
    <version>: The specific version of the project.
  
  - Build Configuration:
    - Contains the build configuration for the project, such as the source directory, test source directory, and output directory.
  
  - Dependencies:
    - Contains the list of dependencies required by the project. 
  
  - Plugins:
    - Defines the list of plugins that are used in the build process.
  
  - Repositories:
    - Defines the list of remote repositories from which dependencies and plugins can be downloaded.
  
  - Profiles:
    - Allows the definition of different configurations for different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

- Maven Repository: A maven repository is a directory of packaged JAR file with pom.xml file. Maven searches for dependencies in the repositories. 

  - Local Repository: 
      It reffers to the machine of the developeers whhere all the project material is stored.
  - Remote Repository: 
      It is a repository on a web server from which Maven can download dependencies.
      It often used for hosting projects internal to the organization.
  - Central Repository: 
      The central Maven repository is created by Maven community. 
      Maven looks in this central repository for any dependencies needed when not found in your local repository.
