Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources, like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, over the internet (the "cloud").
Allowing users to access and utilize them without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure. 


- EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud:
  - Amazon EC2 provides on-demand, scalable computing Services Cloud. Providing opction like storage, networking, operating system. 
  - Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster.

  - EC2 types:
    - General purpose:  Offer a balanced balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, 
    suitable for a wide range of workloads. 
    - Compute Optimized:  designed for CPU-intensive workloads, providing high-performance compute capabilities. 
    - Memory Optimized: Offer a high amount of memory per vCPU, suitable for workloads that require large datasets or in-memory processing.
    - Storage Optimized: Offer high storage throughput and capacity, suitable for workloads that require a large amount of storage.
  
  - EC2 pricing:
    - On-Demand
    - Reserved Instances
    - EC2 Instance Savings Plans
    - Spot Instances
    - Dedicated Hosts
  
  - EC2 Scalability: It involves beginning with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to 
    changing demand by scaling out or in. 

- Serverless computing: your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers.
  - With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers.

  - AWS Lambda: is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.
    - You pay only for the compute time you consume.

- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that manages containerized applications. 
  It allows users to run, stop, and scale containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. 

- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS): is a fully managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the process of running Kubernetes clusters on AWS, 
  allowing you to focus on building and deploying applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. 

- AWS Fargate: is a technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances.

- Elastic Load Balancing: Is a AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources.
  - A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming or outgoing web traffic to your Auto Scaling group. 

  Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
  - This is a template that contains the software configuration needed to launch an EC2 instance.
  - Users can create their own AMIs by customizing existing EC2 instances.

  AWS Region: 
  - It is a group of AWS resources in a specific geographical area.
  - These locations are composed of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones.
    Availability Zone is a single Data Center or a group of Data Centers in a region.
  
  In Asia (Mumbai) regian there is  ap-south-1  is availability zone. there can be many availability zone in one regian.
  
  Subnets:
  - subnets are a logical partition of an Internet Protocol (IP) network broken into multiple, smaller network segments.
  
  Security Group:
  - It act as a virtual firewall, managing the incoming and outcoming traffic for one or more Amazon EC2 instances in VPC.
  - we can add one security group to multiple ec2, multiple security group to ec2.  
 
 Public vs Elastic IP:
  - A Public IP address associated with an instance is not static and is lost when the instance is stopped, 
  whereas an Elastic IP address is a static public address associated with your AWS account.

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Services):
  - It is used to managed database for PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, and Oracle.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
  - With Amazon, it has become easy to store data anytime, anywhere with Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), 
  It is an object storage service offering scalability, availability, security, and high-performing. 
  - Amazon S3 is the perfect fit for big businesses where a large amount of data is managed for diff purposes.

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store):
  - Amazon EBS helps to securely manage transactions. You can handle diverse workloads, be it relational, non-relational, or business applications. 
  - It's providing block-level storage helps to resize workloads for big data analytics engines such as Hadoop and Spark.

Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management):
  - Amazon IAM allows users to securely access and manage resources. To achieve complete access to the tools and resources provided by AWS.
  - It gives you the right to have control over who has authentication (signed in) and authorization (has permissions) to access the resources. 
  - It comes with attribute-based access control which helps you to create separate permissions on the basis of the userâ€™s attributes such as job role, department, etc.

- IAM Identities: 
 - Users:  Create users to give access the AWS services and define permissions and if we can keep track of their login information.
 - Groups: is a collection of users, and a single person can be a member of several groups. we can manage permissions for many users quickly and efficiently.
 - Roles: Roles are often used by AWS services or applications running on AWS to access other AWS resources securely. Provides temporary access to AWS resources.
 - Policies: policies are attached to users, groups, or roles and specify what actions they are allowed or denied to perform on which AWS resources.

Amazon CloudFront:
  - Amazon CloudFront is an AWS service for content delivery networks, it delivers content globally, 
  offering high performance and security and also at high transfer speeds and low latency(rate of time).
  - It uses automated network mapping and intelligent routing mechanisms for delivering content to the destination.

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
  - it enables you to set up an isolated section where you can deploy AWS resources at scale in a virtual environment. 
  - This service is responsible to control the virtual networking environment such as resource placement, security, and connectivity.
  - Using VPC, you get complete access to control the environment, such as choosing IP address, subset creation, and route table arrangement.
