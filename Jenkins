- Continuous integration:
Before CI developers on a team might work in isolation and only merge their changes to the master branch once their work was completed.
This made merging code changes difficult and time-consuming, and also resulted in bugs accumulating for a long time without correction.
To solve this problem CI come in picture.where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, 
after which automated builds and tests are run.

- Build stage: n DevOps, a build is the process of compiling and packaging source code into an executable form

- Continuous delivery 
It is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
It lets developers automate testing beyond just unit tests so they can verify application updates across multiple dimensions before deploying to customers.
These tests may include UI testing, load testing, integration testing.

- Continuous deployment (CD)
It is a software release process where code changes are automatically deployed to a production environment where feedback is collected from user for improvement.

- Jenkins:
    - Jenkins is a open-source tool that is used for automation. It allows all the developers to build, test and deploy software. 
    - It automates the entire software developement life cycle.
    - It is written in Java and runs on java only. It is platform independent.
    - Jenkins has a large plugin ecosystem that supports many tools which helps in enhancing the functionality of a Jenkins.
    - three stages: Build, Test and Deploy.

- Jenkins pipeline:
    - It is a set of plug-ins to create automated, recurring workflows of CI/CD pipelines.
    - A Jenkins pipeline includes all the tools you need to orchestrate testing, merging, packaging, shipping, and code deployment.
    - A pipeline is typically divided into multiple stages and steps, with each step representing a single task.
