- Continuous integration:
Before CI developers on a team might work in isolation and only merge their changes to the master branch once their work was completed.
This made merging code changes difficult and time-consuming, and also resulted in bugs accumulating for a long time without correction.
To solve this problem CI come in picture.where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, 
after which automated builds and tests are run.

- Build stage: the CI/CD pipeline takes the source code from a version control system and compiles it into executable code.

- Continuous delivery 
It is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
It lets developers automate testing beyond just unit tests so they can verify application updates across multiple dimensions before deploying to customers.
These tests may include UI testing, load testing, integration testing.

- Continuous deployment (CD)
It is a software release process where code changes are automatically deployed to a production environment where feedback is collected from user for improvement.
