Normalization:
- Database normalization is an process used to organize and structure relational databases. 
- This process ensures that data is stored in a way that minimizes redundancy, simplifies querying, and improves data integrity.

Redundancy refers to the repetition of the same data in multiple places within a database.

The First Normal Form – 1NF:
- a single cell must not hold more than one value (atomicity)
- there must be a primary key for identification
- no duplicated rows or columns
- each column must have only one value for each row in the table

The Second Normal Form – 2NF:
- it’s already in 1NF
- has no partial dependency. That is, all non-key attributes are fully dependent on a primary key.

Third Normal Form (3NF):
- It is in 2NF.
- It does not have transitive dependencies.
- In other words, non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes.
  Any such dependency should be removed by creating separate tables.
